=========

2D arena filled with random walkers.

While the walkers move randomly on a 2D lattice within a maze of permanent walls, you can affect their progress by placing and removing temporary walls.  Coax them along a path, separate them into groups, wall them off into their own private cells, or just watch them wander about the map.
